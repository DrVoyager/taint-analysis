Assorted Notes:
- "Even if source code is available, runtime events and conﬁguration often dictate information use; realtime monitoring accounts for these environment speciﬁc dependencies."
- "Applications can share information. Limiting the monitoring system to a single application does not account for ﬂows via ﬁles and IPC between applications, including core system applications designed to disseminate privacy sensitive information."
